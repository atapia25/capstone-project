# Capstone Project
This repository has the jupyter notebooks, bash script and python files, and the necessary .csv data files to run the machine learning models.

To run the Python code within the jupyter notebook, you *must* have Python 3.9.X, as some features in the Tensorflow and Keras libraries will not be able to run on earlier versions of Python, or Python 3.10.X.

Additionally, tensorflow and keras must be up-to-date, at least at version 2.6. Some functionalities in the jupyter notebook code will not work on earlier versions of Tensorflow and Keras.
